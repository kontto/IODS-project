## About me

My name is Jukka Kontto and I'm a PhD student in the University of Helsinki. I'm feeling good right now. I currently have a busy schedule but I was happy to squeeze this course into it. I'm looking forward for participating in IODS and getting an overview about the tools used for documenting and sharing R-code. My supervisor told me about this course already a few years ago.\
